#Droidodoro

Droidodoro is a playground app that mixes the pomodoro technique with Trello.

###Workflow
The first thing the user needs is an authentication token. If no token is stored, the user is immediately brought to the configuration screen where he can get a token from.
Once the token is received, the user can associate three lists from the same board to the todo, doing, done list.

The user is then brough on the tasks screen, where the three lists are visible.

By clicking on a todo item the user is brought on the timer screen, where he can start a pomodoro, pause, set the task to done, etc 

Once a task is moved is also synched with trello. The done tasks receive a comment with the total time / pomodoros spent.


## Things worth noting

### The login / interaction with Trello

### The synchronization with Trello

### The implementation of the timer
